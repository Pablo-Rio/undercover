# Undercover
Undercover is a word-based social deduction game for 3-20 players. In the game, players have forgotten their identities and must rely on secret words to figure out who they are. There are three groups in the game: Civilians, Undercovers, and Mr. Whites. Civilians all receive the same secret word, Undercovers receive a different word from the pair, and Mr. Whites do not receive a secret word. Players go through three phases: description, discussion, and voting, with one player being eliminated at the end of each cycle. The game continues until one group (Civilians, Undercovers, or Mr. Whites) wins.

The game is in terminal, the language is *French*.
